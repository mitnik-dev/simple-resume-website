                            Human Resource Manager<br>
                            Intuitive Research and Technology Corporation<br>
                            12249 Science Dr<br>
                            Orlando, FL 32826</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>To whom it may concern,</strong></p>
        
                        <p>I would like to formally apply for the Intuitive Python Developer Internship found on the University of Central Florida Handshake website. My goal is to expand my Python programming skills from an educational setting to a professional one while working alongside senior-level engineers and scientists. I aspire to build a knowledge base for DevOps such as the basics of agile development, in particular, scrum. I also hope to start developing a professional network and learn skills to facilitate networking in future positions. With both goals in mind, I ultimately want to become more prepared for a career in software development and to add value to this ever-expanding field.</p>
        
                        <p>While I have no experience specifically relating to software development, my experience in food service has built skills integral to this internship. For example, collaborating with a team to achieve a goal was essential to working in food service and will help me as an intern at Intuitive working with fellow interns and leaders. Performing tasks as assigned by past kitchen and front-of-house managers was a regular part of my duties at my former places of employment and has allowed me to appreciate the importance of the day-to-day housekeeping tasks literally and figuratively. As such, this ability translates well for the kind of work I would be doing in this internship.</p>
        
                        <p>I would also like to highlight some of the skills I learned through coursework through my formal education. The posting for this internship mentions there is a required knowledge of Microsoft Office Suite tools such as Word and Excel. You will find in my resume I have taken a class as part of my associate degree that studies specifically that. From that class, I have learned valuable knowledge of Microsoft tools with emphasis on Excel. This knowledge I still call on and develop to this day. Furthermore, I have taken Concepts of Computer Science as part of my requirements for my bachelor’s wherein I learned Python 3.</p>
        
                        <p>I want to use this final opportunity to thank you for taking the time to look over my resume and thank you for the opportunity at this internship. I hope you have found that I am a qualified candidate and that an interview is the next step. In such a case, I am best reached by email which I have listed above.</p>
        
                        <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong><br>
                            Charlie Mitnik</p>
        
                        <p><mark>Note:</mark> This cover letter is tailored for the Python Developer Internship application at Intuitive Research and Technology Corporation.</p>
